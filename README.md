# Physical Simulation

## Introduction

**Topics:** _Physical Simulation_, _Rigid Body Simulation_, _Forward Dynamics_

**Skills:** _Unity3D_, _C#_

## How to run the code

Open `Assets > Scenes > Assignment3.unity` with `Unity3D`. Press the `play` button to run the code.

## Demo

As is shown below, the white dice's behavior (with `our physical simulation`) is very similar to the yellow dice (with `Unity3D's built-in physical simluation`).
