# Physical Simulation

## 1. Introduction

In this assignment, I implemented a rigid body simulator using forward dynamics. Specifically, I implemented _collision detection_, and I _compute the forces and torques_ and _integrate physical variables through time_ to complete a rigid body simulation system that can mimic Unity3D's build-in system as much as possible.

**Topics:** _Physical Simulation_, _Rigid Body Simulation_, _Forward Dynamics_

**Skills:** _Unity3D_, _C#_

## 2. How to run the code

Open `Assets > Scenes > Assignment3.unity` with `Unity3D`. Press the `play` button to run the code.

## 3. Demo

As is shown below, the white dice's behavior (with `our physical simulation`) is very similar to the yellow dice (with `Unity3D's built-in physical engine`).
